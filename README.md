Machine Learning Model for Material's Property Prediction


Goal: Magnetic property of a material depends on the Temperature they are measured. On the other side, Temperature directly affects the material structure. The last sentence suggests that atomic displacement (the position of the atoms in materials) is a function of Temperature. Once you displace the atoms, the magnetic property also changes. Quantum Mechanical Calculations can predict magnetic properties (such as D tensor ) as a function of atomic displacement. However, this process can take years. For example, we required 600K heavy Quantum Mechanical Calculations. Hence, we want to propose a machine-learning model which can predict magnetic properties (D tensor) as a function of atomic displacement.
